### Executive Summary
//Description of the game idea, premise, and platform

Audience Analysis: //Who is the target audience (age, gender, type of players, occupation)

### Formal Elements
Player Interaction Pattern: Multilateral Competition
Objective: Race/Solution
Procedures: 
* Who: Minimum 2 players 
* What: All players are cats moving to different locations in computer memory.
* Where: In a computer (cube)
* How: Players must touch the obstacles in a specific order.  The player will use W and D to accelerate and decelerate, A and D to change direction.

Rules: 4 addresses are listed on a screen that show the targets the player must hit. The first player to hit the targets in the correct order wins.  When a correct target is hit, it will chang to red for the player and the player will gain a point. When an incorrest target is hit, it will flash red, and gravity will change directions for all players.

Resources: Player characters and Target cubes.

Conflict: Players compete with each other to hit the targets first.  Players can move the targets and can invert gravity by hitting the wrong target, impeding other's progress.

Boundaries: The game is in a 3-d “cube” that contains the game with random obstacles.

Outcome: The first player to hit the targets in the correct order wins and all targets are deactivated.

Unusual Procedure: Gravity will change directions when a player hits an incorrect target and the targets may respawn in different coordinates
